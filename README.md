**Forensics and Security**

This script aims to provide a secure method for uninstalling and scrubbing sensitive data associated with a package. Here are some considerations related to forensics and security:

Root Privileges: The script checks if it is being run with root privileges to ensure that only authorized users can perform these actions.

Package Uninstallation and Purging: 
The script utilizes the apt-get remove --purge command to completely uninstall and purge the specified package and its dependencies. 

This helps ensure that all files and configurations related to the package are removed from the system.

Secure Data Deletion: 
The script employs the shred command to securely delete any remaining data associated with the package and its dependencies. It overwrites the content of the located files 24 times, making it extremely difficult to recover any sensitive information.

Physical File Removal: 
After securely deleting the located files, the script uses the rm command with the -P flag to physically remove the files from the system. This helps prevent any potential recovery of the files through forensic techniques.

Prompted User Input: 
The script prompts the user for input to ensure that the correct package is uninstalled and scrubbed. This prevents accidental deletion of unrelated files and enhances user control.

Feedback and Confirmation: 
The script provides feedback to the user, indicating the actions performed and confirming the successful uninstallation and secure scrubbing of the package and its associated data.

It is important to note that this script is provided as-is, without any warranty or guarantee.
